    <h1>CHRIST-CENTERED EDUCATION</h1>
<p>For every 100 children in Haiti, 40 will never go to school. Of the 60 children who do, 42 will complete primary school, 20 will attend secondary school programs, and only 5 students will go on to graduate from high school. Weâ€™re working to change that! Quality education is vital in our effort to improve the economic structure of Haiti.<br>
Combining the power of the gospel with a quality education can transform an individual and ultimately a nation. Students who have the opportunity to learn in a Christ-centered environment gain a critical foundation not only academically but also in their relationship with God. This increases individual progress and future success with exponential impact.</p>
